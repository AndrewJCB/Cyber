# Archetype Walkthrough

## Recommended OS - ParrotOS or Pwnbox

## Tools Used
- nmap
- smbclient
- impacket
   - mssqlclient.py


## Start
Making sure that you are connected to the HackTheBox vpn using:

   ```sudo openvpn starting_point_<username>.ovpn```

or you're in an open pwnbox window - connect to the machine and copy the target machine IP address. I like to store the target IP in a text file using:

   ```nano target_ip.txt```

So that each time I need to access the target IP I can just open a new terminal window and use
   
   ```cat target_ip.txt```
   
Rather than having to reopen the browser window or traversing through old terminal commands. I also usually create a working directory for the specific box or task
